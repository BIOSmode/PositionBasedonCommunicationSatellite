Cpomplie: Qt Creator 4.11.0  + Visual Statio 2015  and   Visual Statio 2013
environment: win10  VS2013  and  QT 5.9.9 + Qt 5.9.9 (MSVC 2015 64-bit)

This software has developed a positioning software based on the Iridium satellite signal based on the C/C++ language and windows + QT platform, which basically realizes the following functions: 
1. Cooperate with Novatel hardware to realize GPS-based positioning through USB serial communication.
2. Doppler information processing and extraction and image presentation after the hardware collects the input data; 
3. TLE update tool mainly for Iridium and Iridium Next Satellite; 
4. Automatic identification, overhead satellite prediction and positioning based on the extracted Doppler information and the satellite number of the TLE file, and displayed on the graphical interface based on Baidu Map API;
