# PositionBasedonIridium
This software has developed a positioning software based on the Iridium satellite signal based on the C/C++ language and windows + QT platform, which basically realizes the following functions: 1. Doppler information processing and extraction and image presentation after the hardware collects the input data; 2. TLE update tool mainly for Iridium; 3. Automatic identification, overhead satellite prediction and positioning based on the extracted Doppler information and the satellite number of the TLE file, and displayed on the graphical interface based on Baidu Map API;
